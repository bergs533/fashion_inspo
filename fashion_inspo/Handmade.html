<div class="hello">about</div>
<div class="paragraph">Most often we picture clothing on a mannequin, runway, or in a catalog when looking for
    outfits to inspire us. Either way, clothing is a commodity someone else has designed and we purchase. However, only
    recently has the process of making clothes become a commercialized process. For years, women constructed their own
    apparel out of necessity, and modern times have popularized this practice as a hobby. Many have taken to Etsy
    for example as a means to sell their sewn, embroidered, or painted pieces. So, next time you are looking for a new
    outfit, source out a local crafter for a more unique piece, or rather, take up the new skill yourself!
